## ðŸ§  Design Considerations

- All amounts are positive; `type` determines whether it adds to or subtracts from the account balance.
- Linked to each user `account`, enabling multi-account journaling and analysis.
- Supports accurate calculation of account snapshots and PnL charts.
- `description` can be used to label funding sources, withdrawal notes, or internal notes.
