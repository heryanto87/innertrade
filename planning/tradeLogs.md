# üìÑ Trade Log Model Specification

**Purpose:**  
This document defines the structure and logic of the **Trade Log** model used in the Trading Journal Web App.  
It supports multi-stage trade logging for crypto, forex, and commodities, including margin handling, account linking, strategy tracking, and trade journaling.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Auto-Calculated Fields

|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `direction`        | `takeProfit > entryPrice ? "long" : "short"`                        | Inferred from price direction                |
| `marginUsed`       | `positionSize * entryPrice / leverage` (if leverage is defined)     | Calculated for leveraged trades              |
| `exposure`         | `positionSize * entryPrice`                                         | Market exposure                              |

## üß† Design Principles

- Initial and closing inputs are clearly separated for better UX.
- Images are organized into `entryImageUrls` and `closeImageUrls` for before/after journaling.
- `positionUnit` is locked to `"usdt"` or `"lot"` and inferred from account.
- `direction` is derived, not input.
- `strategyId` is optional for flexible workflows.
- `accountId` is required for contextual reporting and performance tracking.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Considerations

- Support partial exits or multiple exit logs per trade
- Upload image metadata (e.g., timestamp, label)
- Add ‚Äúemotions‚Äù or ‚Äúconfidence level‚Äù to entry
- Allow draft/in-progress trades before saving full logs
